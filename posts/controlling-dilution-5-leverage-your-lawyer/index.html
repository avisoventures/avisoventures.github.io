<p>This is part of a series on controling founder dilution during fundraising.</p>
<p>This is also one I find almost all new founders being a bit blindsided by and not prepared for and you’re probably thinking “how does a good lawyer help me reduce dilution???” Lawyers to non-founders typically = expensive and pedantic/rule oriented. While this can be true the best startup lawyers are worth their weight in gold and more. They live and breathe the terms of funding deals and are aware of current trends more than almost anyone who will be on the company’s side of a deal. So a great lawyer will help you navigate the negotiation including what to expect in valuation terms, how to position and even the wording of how to negotiate bids from various investors. They’ll have experience with both the investor and the lawyers they have used in the past to know tendencies of what are trigger issues for them and how to get around/avoid those. And help you strategize expectation setting in one round to the next (aka they can see the problems that will arise in future rounds of funding if you make certain decisions in your current round of funding).</p>
<p>Tradeoffs: Not really any. You have to have a lawyer and you might think getting a basic/cheaper lawyer is better (see side tip 2) but they’re not. An experience start up lawyer that you work well with and can trust is likely your single best advocate and guide in funding rounds to avoid dilution.</p>
<p>Side tip 1: DO NOT USE YOUR FRIENDS/FAMILY LAWYER CAUSE SOMEONE YOU TRUST REFERS YOU TO THEM UNLESS THEY HAVE DEEP START UP EXPERIENCE. Too often I’ve seen people use lawyers cause they have been referred to them and think they are all the same in terms of value add.</p>
<p>Side tip 2: DO NOT TRY TO GET A CHEAPER LAWYER FOR YOUR COMPANY FORMATION AND FUNDRAISING. While other kinds of legal work are commodities, company formation and fundraising is not one of them. Do not cut corners on this and the very best lawyers will be smart about how they charge you and won’t nickel and dime you at the start of your company as they’ll make their real money when your company gets bigger and uses lawyers more regularly for lots of issues (plus they know every dollar saved counts more at the start than later).</p>
<p>Side tip 3: Beware of lawyers that are referred to you by investors. While this is unlikely, sometimes that lawyer may be thinking about what’s in the investors best interest instead of your own even though their fiduciary duty is to you and the company. We used a lawyer who was introduced to us by our seed investor and he was amazing and completely loyal to the company/us. Make sure you interview a few lawyers before choosing the one you ultimately go with.</p>
