<p>“Hey Nick… can we add a box on the marketing website to collect email addresses?”</p>
<p>My head exploded. We are three months into Signal Sciences. I’m the CTO, Founder, Lead Engineer, and probably a dozen more titles. I’m spending long days trying to get a round trip working on the product. And oh yeah, I’m working in Tokyo dealing with 3 timezones in North America. My head exploded. At the previous job I was working on e-mail infrastructure that sent millions of emails for a very large customer base. So…”just a box to collect email?” OMG, We need to store it. And we’ll need a database! And security! And then we’ll need to actually do something with those emails. And then maintaining it. I “told him” (maybe more like exploded):</p>
<ol>
<li>No one is going to put their email in our crappy website.</li>
<li>I can’t make a “box” so go figure something else out.</li>
</ol>
<p>And so he did.</p>
<p>“Hey Nick, I used google forms to add a box to the website”
“Ok great, Andrew”</p>
<p>Then every week or more, for years. And I mean for years, Andrew would call me up with:</p>
<p>“Hey Nick, Guess who put their name in the box? A VP of Very Large Bank”</p>
<p>“Hey Nick, Guess who put their email in the box? CISO of Very Large Company”</p>
<p>“Andrew what did you do? Is this a MAGIC BOX???””</p>
<p>And so it begins.</p>
<p>I tell this story a lot for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Listening to your customer and asking questions. As the “tech guy” in the founding team, my co-founders are my customers. Andrew didn’t ask for a marketing CRM. He just needed to get email so he could manually contact people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everything is an MVP. The easiest fastest thing is probably the smartest thing to do. If no one used the Magic Box, so what. If zillions of people used Magic Box… Well, that’s a great problem. Later Magic Box got a big upgrade and was connected to a CRM.. but that was years later, and without any involvement of engineering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scaling 10x… downward. It’s likely as your previous gig you were responsible for highly performance applications and teams. If you are just starting a new company, you have neither customers, an application or a team and so most experience isn’t relevant to the company. This scaling 10x downward is extremely difficult to do for both yourself and for early hires.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyways I learned my lesson. Andrew didn&rsquo;t have to tell me to add a magic box to Aviso Ventures. Join us.</p>
