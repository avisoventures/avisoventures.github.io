<p>I&rsquo;ve been at more startups than you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Signal Sciences - Founder, CTO, occasional COO and VP Eng.</li>
<li>Etsy - Among other things, I built out their security, fraud, business intelligence systems.</li>
<li>RightMedia / AppNexus / IPONWeb - All were at the birth of programmatic online advertising, all had big exits.</li>
<li>Friendster - Yeah that Friendster. What a wild time.</li>
<li>Upromise - Still around, sorta. I quit when I got the email &ldquo;The company has been devalued by 90%. Would you like to buy more shares?&rdquo;</li>
<li>SightPath - &ldquo;A CDN for the Intranet, in a Box&rdquo; sold to Cisco. Let me tell you what happened when I put a $1M stock certificate in the desk drawer and went on vacation.</li>
<li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Market>Open Market</a> - started in 1994, went IPO and promptly fell into the chasm and died.</li>
</ul>
<p>Along the way I did a lot speaking on the intersection of engineering, operations and security (<a href=https://www.slideshare.net/nickgsuperstar/presentations>examples1</a>, <a href=https://speakerdeck.com/ngalbreath>examples2</a>).</p>
<p>Prior that I bailed out of a PhD program in mathematics at <a href=https://www.bu.edu/math/>Boston University</a>, since I thought this Internet thing might be something. Before that I picked up a mathematics degree from <a href=https://cse.umn.edu/math>University of Minnesota</a> and did research at <a href=https://cnls.lanl.gov/>Los Alamos National Laboratory - T13 group</a>, <a href=https://www.anl.gov/mcs>Argonne National Laboratory</a>, <a href=https://www.msi.umn.edu/>Minnesota Supercomputing Institute</a>, and the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_Center>Geometry Center</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, I authored a large number of <a href="https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=0&f=S&l=50&TERM1=Galbreath%2C+Nicholas&FIELD1=INNM&co1=AND&TERM2=&FIELD2=&d=PTX">patents</a>, a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cryptography-Internet-Database-Applications-Developing/dp/0471210293/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3BB4VEHTZR0UX&keywords=Nick+galbreath&qid=1644966507&sprefix=nick+galbreath%2Caps%2C134&sr=8-1">book on cryptography</a>, and maybe a <a href=https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sc/1993/01263494/12OmNAiXjfe>paper</a> or <a href=https://www.osti.gov/biblio/268500-parallel-solution-three-dimensional-time-dependent-ginzburg-landau-equation>two</a>.</p>

<p>The name <em>aviso</em> comes the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviso>aviso boats</a> which was used to carry messages between other ships, prior to electronic communications.</p>
<p>Our logo came from a design contest at <a href=https://99designs.com/>99 Designs</a>.</p>
<p>The website is static, made with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a>, and hosted on <a href=https://pages.github.com/>Github Pages</a> and deployed using <a href=https://github.com/features/actions>Github Actions</a>. And <a href=https://getbootstrap.com/>Bootstrap</a> for UI components. At least for now.</p>
