&lt;p>Ray Dalio mentiones in his book &amp;ldquo;Principles,&amp;rdquo; the Issue Log that was used to learn from mistakes and radically improve the culture and processes at Bridgewater.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It works like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Errors or mistakes go in the Issue Log, with description, severity and &amp;ldquo;who was responsible&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If it goes in the log, all is ok&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If mistake is found, and not in the log, there will be problems.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Management&amp;rdquo; needs to review the issue log in a timely, regular manner with some process.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re planning to present company-wide all-employees KPIs, make sure they are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Durable – KPIs should remain stable over time and not change frequently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Transparent – Results should be shared early and often with the organization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Applicable – KPIs must apply broadly to everyone, not just a select few.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Achievable – They must be realistically attainable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Incremental – Progress should be measurable continuously, not only at rare &amp;ldquo;big bang&amp;rdquo; milestones.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Company-wide KPIs sound like a great idea: announce them, and everyone works toward improving them!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Moving from Engineer to Manager</title><link>https://avisoventures.com/posts/moving-from-eng-to-manager-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://avisoventures.com/posts/moving-from-eng-to-manager-2/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="thinking-of-moving-from-engineer-to-manager">Thinking of Moving from Engineer to Manager?&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>So you are thinking about going into management? Here&amp;rsquo;s the problem. You don&amp;rsquo;t know what management even is.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You don&amp;rsquo;t have visibility into what your boss even does. Your crappy 1-1s with your boss and various reporting is a small fraction of the job. The rest you don&amp;rsquo;t see.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most startups have &amp;ldquo;quasi-management.&amp;rdquo; The management for initial build out is very different than what management is at a mature company.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Management, for skilled, creative people, is a really new field. Like less than 100 years old. It&amp;rsquo;s changing all the time as we, meaning humans, figure it out.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A lot of people in management should not be in management. That&amp;rsquo;s all I&amp;rsquo;ll say on that.&lt;/li>
