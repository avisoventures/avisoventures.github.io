This one is kind of a “duh” concept but before starting a company myself, I mostly figured that the more money you raised the better it was for the company. You read headlines about fundraises and see massive numbers and associate the higher the number the better the company is doing. Sorta… Yes, it means investors were willing to put more money into a company to back them, but it also means more of the company was sold in the process.</description></item><item><title>Controlling Dilution 2 - Raising at a Higher Valuation</title><link>https://avisoventures.com/posts/controlling-dilution-2-higher-valuation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://avisoventures.com/posts/controlling-dilution-2-higher-valuation/</guid><description>This one is also kind of a no-brainer that the higher the valuation you get from investors in each round of funding, the higher the price is per share thus cash invested in the company at lower rates of dilution.
One of the best ways I’ve seen this executed in early rounds of funding is to raise a SAFE instead of a priced round to push out when the value gets set for the purchase price of equity.</description></item><item><title>Controlling Dilution 3 - The Employee Option Pool</title><link>https://avisoventures.com/posts/controlling-dilution-3-option-pool/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://avisoventures.com/posts/controlling-dilution-3-option-pool/</guid><description>This was probably the one I was the least prepared for when it came to dilution management and I have my seed funder Michael Dearing from Harrison Metal to thank for this lesson. When you start the company you will create a pool of equity that you set aside for employees instead of just granting shares each time a new employee starts (like I thought happened). This is a structure that makes it much simpler to manage new employee equity grants.</description></item><item><title>Controlling Dilution 4 - Raise Debt Instead of Equity</title><link>https://avisoventures.com/posts/controlling-dilution-4-debt-instead-of-equity/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://avisoventures.com/posts/controlling-dilution-4-debt-instead-of-equity/</guid><description>Debt basically means you’re raising money from a bank/financial entity that will loan you money that you will have to pay back in the future but that you can use to finance growth of your company instead of having to sell equity and dilute the company. This is an intuitive concept but a relatively uncommon path for raising money so I find it to be something a lot of founders I know don’t think about as much.</description></item><item><title>Controlling Dilution 5 - Ask Your Lawyer</title><link>https://avisoventures.com/posts/controlling-dilution-5-leverage-your-lawyer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://avisoventures.com/posts/controlling-dilution-5-leverage-your-lawyer/</guid><description>This is also one I find almost all new founders being a bit blindsided by and not prepared for and you’re probably thinking “how does a good lawyer help me reduce dilution???” Lawyers to non-founders typically = expensive and pedantic/rule oriented. While this can be true the best startup lawyers are worth their weight in gold and more. They live and breathe the terms of funding deals and are aware of current trends more than almost anyone who will be on the company’s side of a deal.</description></item></channel></rss>
