When doing fundraising it&amp;rsquo;s natural to focus on increasing the company&amp;rsquo;s valuation. However, you are in fact making an independant bet that you can grow the company larger than your personal dilution. Otherwise why bother doing it? We have seen numerous cases of founders &amp;ldquo;doubling down&amp;rdquo; by taking VC funding, having dilution, workng 5 more years, and then get the exact same exit they would have gotten in the beginning.</description></item><item><title>Controlling Dilution 7 - Ask The Board for More</title><link>https://avisoventures.com/posts/controlling-dilution-7-ask-for-more/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://avisoventures.com/posts/controlling-dilution-7-ask-for-more/</guid><description>This is part of a series on controlling foudner dilution.
One antonymn of &amp;ldquo;dilute&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;enrich,&amp;rdquo; and you can definitely enrich yourself. As a founder you are an employee like everyone else. And the board wants you motivated. The board can issue new option grants to you, which has the opposite effect of dillution.
The board is unlikely to be proactive here, so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to ask. Typically these shares don&amp;rsquo;t come out of the option pool, but from the investor&amp;rsquo;s own shares, so don&amp;rsquo;t expect a whole lot here.</description></item><item><title>Masters of Scale - Getting To No</title><link>https://avisoventures.com/posts/masters-of-scale-01-getting-to-no/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://avisoventures.com/posts/masters-of-scale-01-getting-to-no/</guid><description>My wife brought home Reid Hoffman’s “Masters of Scale” from the public library.: If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with Reid, he&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; uh&amp;hellip; a very well known investor, focusing primarily on business with network effects. Oh yeah he founded LinkedIn too.
The first chapter is “Getting to No” – all about the different types of Nos you’ll get from investors, and how to use them to your advantage. Signal Sciences certainly had its share of Nos over the course of five fundraising rounds, so I was curious to hear what Reid Hoffman has to say.</description></item><item><title>The Legend of Magic Box</title><link>https://avisoventures.com/posts/the-legend-of-magic-box/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://avisoventures.com/posts/the-legend-of-magic-box/</guid><description>“Hey Nick… can we add a box on the marketing website to collect email addresses?”
My head exploded. We are three months into Signal Sciences. I’m the CTO, Founder, Lead Engineer, and probably a dozen more titles. I’m spending long days trying to get a round trip working on the product. And oh yeah, I’m working in Tokyo dealing with 3 timezones in North America. My head exploded. At the previous job I was working on e-mail infrastructure that sent millions of emails for a very large customer base.</description></item></channel></rss>
