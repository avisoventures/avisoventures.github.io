Oh yeah he founded LinkedIn too.
The first chapter is “Getting to No” – all about the different types of Nos you’ll get from investors, and how to use them to your advantage. Signal Sciences certainly had its share of Nos over the course of five fundraising rounds, so I was curious to hear what Reid Hoffman has to say.</description></item><item><title>The Legend of Magic Box</title><link>https://avisoventures.com/posts/the-legend-of-magic-box/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://avisoventures.com/posts/the-legend-of-magic-box/</guid><description>“Hey Nick… can we add a box on the marketing website to collect email addresses?”
My head exploded. We are three months into Signal Sciences. I’m the CTO, Founder, Lead Engineer, and probably a dozen more titles. I’m spending long days trying to get a round trip working on the product. And oh yeah, I’m working in Tokyo dealing with 3 timezones in North America. My head exploded. At the previous job I was working on e-mail infrastructure that sent millions of emails for a very large customer base.</description></item></channel></rss>
