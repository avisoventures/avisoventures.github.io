&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re planning to present company-wide all-employees KPIs, make sure they are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Durable – KPIs should remain stable over time and not change frequently.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Most startups have &amp;ldquo;quasi-management.&amp;rdquo; The management for initial build out is very different than what management is at a mature company.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Management, for skilled, creative people, is a really new field. Like less than 100 years old. It&amp;rsquo;s changing all the time as we, meaning humans, figure it out.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A lot of people in management should not be in management. That&amp;rsquo;s all I&amp;rsquo;ll say on that.&lt;/li>
