&lt;ul>
&lt;li>“Don’t say this.”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Be careful—they might trick you.”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>“Stick to the script.”&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>But playing it safe leads to boring interviews. And boring = forgettable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here’s what actually works 👇&lt;/p>
&lt;p>💡 A few truths first:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No one knows anything about your startup.
Even if you think you’ve made it—VCs are reaching out, people are talking—you’re still a nobody to the broader world. Assume that.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Writers are not out to get you.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Unless you’re a massive jerk (and that becomes the story), most journalists aren’t looking to do a hit piece. They usually want to write something positive—or at the very least, balanced. Trashing a founder can come off as petty, and writers don’t want to risk burning bridges with your network (investors, lawyers, team, founder friends, etc.).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
