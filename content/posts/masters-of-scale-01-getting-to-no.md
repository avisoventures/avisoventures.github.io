My wife brought home Reid Hoffman’s “Masters of Scale” from the public library.:  If you aren't familiar with Reid, he's... uh... a very well known investor, focusing primarily on business with network effects.  Oh yeah he founded LinkedIn too.

The first chapter is “Getting to No” – all about the different types of Nos you’ll get from investors, and how to use them to your advantage. Signal Sciences certainly had its share of Nos over the course of five fundraising rounds, so I was curious to hear what Reid Hoffman has to say.

The examples are mostly B2C companies raising a seed round but the principles are universal: accept that Nos are part of the process, discount the Nos that have no value, use the honest Nos to refine your vision, and keep going. He categorized the Nos in five ways:

* The Lazy No - their no give no additional information
* The Squirmy No - their no means a strong maybe
* The Affirmative No - their no means you are corrective
* The Honest No – their no means you are incorrect
* The Unhelpful or Discouraging No – their no will needlessly impact your relationship or mood (e.g. a “no” from your family)

Sounds simple, right? Except that the fundraising process is can be highly emotional. So while nothing earth-shattering, its good to have a common vocabulary when doing a pitch post-mortem. It's filled with a number of examples demonstrating each type of No, and how to extract any value they may have.
 
It’s a promising start to the book. It certainly got me thinking… and writing…
