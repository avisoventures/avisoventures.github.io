This is part of a series on controling founder dilution during fundraising.

This one is also kind of a no-brainer that the higher the valuation you get from investors in each round of funding, the higher the price is per share thus cash invested in the company at lower rates of dilution. 

One of the best ways I’ve seen this executed in early rounds of funding is to raise a SAFE instead of a priced round to push out when the value gets set for the purchase price of equity. There’s plenty of nuances here but this one is pretty obvious. Higher price per share = less dilution for the same amount of money invested in the company. 

Tradeoffs: Raising money at higher rates means:
* higher expectations from your investors to return bigger outcomes which can produce various amounts of higher stress for you 
* higher strike price for incoming employees thus creating lower value for new employees which can make it harder to higher talented employees and can, in some cases, lead to complicated tax/risk questions for employees when it comes to exercising options
* it can price you out of potential acquiring companies who either don’t the budget to buy you over your most recent valuation and don’t want to have to fight your board in the acquisition process who will not want to take a loss on their investment or have to go through a much more rigorous approval process (like getting their board’s approval) on a transaction to buy the company. 

Side tip 1: Most acquiring companies seems to have a level they can buy companies at where they don’t need deep approval and revenue multiples are negligible to the deal terms that seems to currently be in the $200-300 million range for large public companies. So valuations under that likely don’t carry the “priced out of acquisitions” risk.

Side tip 2: Your ability to raise at higher valuations is fully based on the market competition for your deal. If you only have one investor who is offering to invest at a given price and you think your company is worth more, tough shit, you’re wrong. If you have many, you have more power to negotiate.
