This is part of a series on controlling foudner dilution.

One antonymn of "dilute" is "enrich," and you can definitely enrich yourself. As a founder you are an employee like everyone else.  And the board wants you motivated.  The board can issue new option grants to you, which has the opposite effect of dillution.

The board is unlikely to be proactive here, so you'll have to ask. And typically these shares don't come out of the option pool, but from the investor's own shares, so don't expect a whole lot here.

The best cases of getting a new grant are at the extremes:
* when things are going so badly the investors expect $0 return, so tere is little cost in the investors giving a new grant, and maybe it helps turn things around. 
* when things are going very well, so they can afford to be give some extra to the founders.
* when you have been so diluted and have an especially low ownership, they feel bad for you.
* when your initial revest has expired, and they fear you might walk out

Founder and board dynamics here matter as well, and there are definitely conflicts of the interest all around, but it's worth investigating.
