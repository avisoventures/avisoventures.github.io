When investors hear things like this for seed stage b2b companies it tends to mean one of two things and they're both generally bad. 

1️⃣ (most common) There is no market for this product and customers do not have this in a near term (and likely long term) budget to spend on this. 

Implication: This will make GTM cycles hard if not impossible. 

2️⃣ They are going to create a new market category with their product. 

Implication: This is going to be very very expensive to get off the ground and scale. 

The second can be a good thing if you're building on top of some SERIOUS tail winds and in a market that can be huge. This tends to be the areas Tier 1s gravitate towards investing in for a variety of reasons (hello WIZ!) but there's big risk and big reward here. You will need to convince deep pocketed investors to join you and hope they're particularly patient. 

Even still, I would recommend you do not pitch "no competitors". Identify the incumbent competitor that is the biggest and closest to what you're building that you will eventually take down. It's always easier to steal existing budget than to force people to make new ones.
