When to start marketing for your website. Ffor a certain demographic, the answer would be “You are already too late, you should have done it a long time ago”.   But for us older folks, especially those in engineering, it can be seem distasteful to start marketing something that doesn’t exist yet.  I mean you are busy just trying to make something work.  That’s certainly how I felt at Signal Sciences in the early days.

Get over it.  

First, it’s software.  You can make it work.  You will make it work.

Second, in absence of product, the only thing you can sell is… your brand and vision.

Your brand?  Yah.  At this point all you can sell is that:

You understand the problem
You and your team can solve it

You don’t even need to talk about your solution as you might want to keep it secret for a while.

The first thing any potential employee or customer is going to do is visit your website.  Does it show you understand the problem?  Does it show you can solve it? 

The lack of product doesn’t actually matter since angel customers *don’t actually care about the actual product*, they are actually buying you and your vision.  And your vision might take 6 weeks or 6 years to be complete.  Your magic box should be collecting emails of people who are interested in the space.

It takes time to establish expertise.  So go start a company blog, and block off Wednesday 10-11 to write a post every week.

What to write about? In some ways it doesn’t even matter, as long as it solves those two goals.

The Signal Sciences early days blog was more on DevOps and wasn’t particularly focused on security or even the product.  Perhaps it should have been different, but we were extremely adverse to “sizzle” marketing. It established we understood modern systems, and that we had smart people working on hard problems.  And it got a lot of traffic.
