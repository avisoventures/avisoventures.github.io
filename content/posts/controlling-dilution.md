Founder (and employee) dilution during fundraising is natural and required.  How much dilution however is, at least partially, controllable. And the amount of dilution can be the difference between an "ok" exit and "f-you money" exit.  It's not uncommon for founders to own less than 5% of the company after exit, and in some cases 1%.  At Signal Sciecnes, the founders still controled over 46% of the company at exit.  How did we do it?

First-time founders (myself included) typically have a very weak understanding of fundraising and cap table management, which leads to excessive unintentional dilution.  This isn't surprising since it's probably completely different than anything they have done before.  To help is my crash course on controling dilution.  I find myself sharing these tips with almost every new founder I speak with, and these come from personal learnings (sometimes the hard way) starting and building Signal Sciences. All these suggestions have tradeoffs associated with them. Decisions around this topic needs to be evaluated in the context of your specific company/situation and your profile for risk.   Good luck!
