I speak with a lot of startups on hiring, and one thing I demand they do is put up a divserity and inclusion page on their website.  Like right now.  Do it today. 

There are many reasons to have a D&I page. But you want to have it for much more selfish reasons -- survival. As founder I can not afford to miss any great canidates.  And great canidates come in every flavor.  And you want the canidate to know that too.

"But Nick, my startup is 5 white guys!'  Yes! Exactly. All the more reason to do it. That's where you are.  Let's talk about it.

The fact you have a D&I page, shows you give damn and probably puts you in the top 10% of all startups.  And more than that you actually do give a damn since you need every canidate you find.

If you are in fact you are not diverse, this is your page to talk about it.  And you, founder, this is a good chance to use the first person voice. But not trivalize historical and current issues in the USA, but you are probably more diverse than you realize.  Beside race and gender

* Age --
* Employees with Children -- 
* Geographic -- remote? where?
* Educational -- is everyone from a top-tier school? or community colleges?
* Veteran Status -- ?
* Nationality or Immigrant status - 
* Religion -- is a bit tricky, but you company policy could allow for Jewisha and Islamic holidays

Not doubt I'm missing some and please adjust to your local environment.  I've worked in Japan and Russia.  I'm talking to startups in the EU and Israel.  Diversity and Inclusion there all mean different things.  But at the end of the day, you want a canidate or prospect to feel welcome, that they could belong, whoever they are.
