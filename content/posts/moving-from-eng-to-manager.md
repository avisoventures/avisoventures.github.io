# ⁉️Thinking of Moving from Engineer to Manager?🙋
## Here's the book I recommend to read first. 📖 You can't beat Drucker.

So you are thinking about "going into management." Here's the problem. You don't know what management even is.

➡️You don't have visbility into what your boss even does. Your crappy 1-1s with your boss and various reporting is a small fraction of the job. The rest you don't see. 

➡️ Most startups have "quasi-management." The management for initial build out is very different than what management is at a mature company.

➡️ Management, for skilled, creative people, is a really new field. Like less than 100 years old. It's changing all the time as we, meaning humans, figure it out.

➡️ A lot of people in management should not be in management. That's all I'll say on that.🥺

About once a week someone asks for career advice on something. When it comes to management, I tell them to read:

👀📕The Essential Drucker. The best of Sixty Years of Peter Drucker's Essential Writings on Management.

It's definitely at your public library or you can buy it used for $6, you cheapo.

He's more or less the "father of modern management," and the book is 26 essays across various topics. Some more and some less relevant to your career dilemma. Pick what looks interesting.

If you read the book and think it's boring... maybe figure out what's bothering you with your current individual contributor role, and 🙏🏽please do not go into management.🙏🏽

On the other hand if you found it... exciting... inspiring ... go for it. 💥

Any good engineering manager would be delighted in helping someone get started. A first step is to ask your boss about their job. You might be surprised at the answers.
