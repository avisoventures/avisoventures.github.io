I've spoken with two founders who have tackled a "90 in 90 days challenge" to engage potential customers. For founders, especially tech founders, adjusting to "always-on sales" can be challenging, which is why I love this gamified approach to customer outreach.

In one case, the founder was pre-product and wasn’t actively selling anything yet. Instead, he used the opportunity to ask crucial product questions, identify potential buyers, determine budget sources, and understand their willingness to pay. During each call or in-person meeting, he also asked for introductions to two additional contacts.

The second founder’s company already had products and customers, but with lower contract sizes and ARR. They took on the 90-in-90 challenge to discover which new features customers would be willing to pay for—and to get referrals to other potential customers.

As a founder, you have unique "magic powers" for connecting with people. Use them!

There’s no substitute for this kind of outreach. You can’t outsource it to sales, marketing, a third-party firm, or rely on mass events for lead generation. You must actively connect with people through calls or in-person meetings. 

Take on the 90 customers in 90 days challenge, and let me know how it goes!
