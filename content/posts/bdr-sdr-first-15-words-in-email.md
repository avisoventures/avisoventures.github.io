üó£Ô∏è‚úâÔ∏è BDR/SDRs: The First 15 Words Decide if I Open An Email
Make them Count, Here's How.

The role of the BDR / SDR is critical for enterprise sales. However open rates have been dropping. That's no surprise as the volume has been increasing. AI is not helping. AI has been trained on crappy emails to generate... more crappy email.

##  Here's how to fix your outbound emails.

The first 10-15 words of the email are critical. Look at the screenshot. That's how any busy person decides if they open the email. I'll let you figure out how to state your value proposition or what problem you are solving in under 15 words. But to do it, follow these five rules:

## Stop Pretending To Be Polite

There is nothing polite about sending a sales email, and that's OK! But adding personalization, passive voice intros, and indirect openers, does not make you or your email polite. It wastes time and buries your goal. 

## Drop the Greetings and Salutations

Every guide to email says "use personalization to improve open rates" -- That's completely wrong for enterprise sales. Let's remove:

 "Dear/Hi/Hey/Hello/Hi There/Good Morning/ [FIRST NAME]

This is fooling no one. This is not a personal email, so stop pretending it is. 

## Drop the Fluff

All of this can be removed:

* "I'll keep this short" 
* "I recently noticed" 
* "I'm reaching out to see"
* "I hope you are doing fine"
* "I'm sure you are receiving ...." 
* "I just wanted to drop you a quick note" 
* "I wanted to follow up with you"
* "For color..."
* "If you'd like to take a look"
* "Might you have some time"
* "I'm checking to see"

## Be DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself.

The sender's name, subject, and first sentence should not repeat anything. Very often the company name is repeated. The worst is a double introduction where the subject is "Hi Nick..." and then the body is also "Hi Nick...".

## Send it to Yourself First

Check it on your laptop, on your phone, in Gmail, in Apple Mail, any mobile app you can find. Then review the other rules, and do it again, until it's tight. 

# How To Fix It Using AI.

Take your existing crappy outbound email and use this prompt:

 "Rewrite to be more concise:"

That's it! You're welcome. (I also use "Rewrite to be a text message" for email subjects).


## Summary

Open rates for email is just a number. What you want are *leads*. Spending extra time on those first 15 words will help you get them.
