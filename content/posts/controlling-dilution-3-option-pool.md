This was probably the one I was the least prepared for when it came to dilution management and I have my seed funder Michael Dearing from Harrison Metal to thank for this lesson. When you start the company you will create a pool of equity that you set aside for employees instead of just granting shares each time a new employee starts (like I thought happened). This is a structure that makes it much simpler to manage new employee equity grants. 

The real tip here is that the investors will want you to create this pool to be as large as possible as it gets created prior to their investment (aka they don’t dilute when the pool gets created) and the more equity that is in the pool before they invest, the less they will dilute in the future if more equity needs to be added to the pool for new employees. So, unless you have a clear, bottoms up hiring plan that calculates your expected dilution, you’ll likely be at the whim of the investor to tell you what the pool needs to be and have no way to push back. 

So go do this:

* Build a hiring model for the next 18 months for all your expected hires. 
* Use any source of information you can to predict the amount of equity that you’ll need to grant those employees and add it up.
* Add a 25-30% buffer for being wrong on amount per employee or expected hires

And there you have your option pool plan. 

Now if the investor wants to push back on the option pool number that you’re proposing, they must have a constructive conversation with you about your hiring plan and they typically don’t have the operating experience to know how to push back. 

Trade off: There’s not many downsides to doing this. You should have a plan regardless and you should have a general idea of how much it’s going to take to hire people. If you’re wrong and  or must change your hiring plan to hire more senior people, you can expand the pool and everyone on the existing cap table dilutes evenly. 

Side tip 1: Put all founders on a vesting schedule. Life happens and if founders aren’t all on a vesting schedule, they may own a lot more of the company than they deserve if they’re not contributing to the company cause they’re not part of the company anymore. This matters as it relates to the employee option pool cause if people leave before they’ve vested their options, they typically roll back into the option pool. But it’s also just a generally good thing to do regardless. 

Side tip 2: Try to get on a schedule with your board as soon as you can to review the option pool in board meetings and do periodic pool refreshes so that you don’t get stuck in expanding the option pool in each round of funding like the investors would prefer. Evaluation the option pool every 6 months is a reasonable schedule and if you get pushback from your board, it’s a hard one for them to say no to as its general good governance.
