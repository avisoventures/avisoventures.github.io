This article is part of a series on [controlling founder dilution]({{< ref "/posts/controlling-dilution" >}}).

When doing fundraising it's natural to focus on increasing the company's valuation.  However, you are in fact making an independant bet that you can grow the company larger than your personal dilution. Otherwise why bother doing it?  We have seen numerous cases of founders "doubling down" by taking VC funding, having dilution, workng 5 more years, and then get the exact same exit they would have gotten in the beginning. This happens. Sure the company was sold for more but the founder ended up "working for the VCs" for 5 extra years with no additional personal benefit (other than salary, and maybe bragging rights).

For example, let's say you are a single founder owning 50% of a company worth $10M. So if you sold the company today, you'd get $5M. Then you sell 20% of your stake, so after fundraising, you have 40% of the company. It doens't matter what the VCs give you or what the valuation of the company is.  You just made a bet that the company will be worth $12.5M.  In otherwords, to get $5M, the company would need to be sold for $12.5M (12.5 * 0.40 = $5M).

At the seed stage, a bump of $10M to $12.5M isn't so farfetched. But that's a 25% increase in valuation. And in later rounds, multiply the all these numbers by 10 or 20.  And then the last round valuation might have been a bit agresive. And then the market was really hot.  Then going foward any market correction or slow down in sales might significantly impact your valuation.

When fundraising, it's normal to present your best guess of growth. Just don't fool yourself. And one might need to do another round just to keep going so you can be sold at all. Fair enough. Just don't forget the cost of doing so.  The actual numbers and situation really matter here but sometimes, not diluting at all is the best choice.
