#Avoiding the Enterprise Site License Trap for Seed-Stage Companies

## Why "Land and Expand" Outperforms "Big Bang" Deals

A seed-stage company gets interest from a champion at a Very Big Company. The champion loves the product so much that they propose an enterprise site license. Excitement surges—this could be a six-figure deal and a marquee reference customer! The sales rep, eager for a big win, goes all in.

But hold on. While every situation is unique, here’s why this often goes sideways:

The Seed-Stage Company Isn’t Ready
====================================

* Product, compliance, support, and services aren’t mature enough to handle an enterprise deal. This is likely to disappoint the customer and delay the deal.
* The deal is likely underpriced, leaving money on the table.
* Sidelines other, more scalable, revenue opportunities.


The Champion/Customer Isn’t Ready
==================================

* Champions, though well-intentioned, often lack knowledge of their company’s procurement and approval processes.
* Political and organizational complexities arise, adding requirements and time that can derail the deal.

How to Play It
===============

Step back. Instead of chasing the biggest deal, target the smallest viable one. A smaller group, secondary property, or subsystem is a more manageable entry point. This approach:

* Still involves navigating procurement but is far more achievable
* Faster revenue (even if small) and can still use the Big Company's logo.
* Allows you to deliver value and give your champion a win.
* Once you’ve proven your value, expand aggressively.
* Can increase pricing and services for future deals.

Don’t fall for the enterprise site license trap. "Land and Expand" beats "Big Bang" every time.
