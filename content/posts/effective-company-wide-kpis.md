# Five Attributes of Good Company-wide KPIs
## They can be powerful motivators or demovitators if done incorrectly.
---
If you're planning to present company-wide all-employees KPIs, make sure they are:

* Durable – KPIs should remain stable over time and not change frequently.
* Transparent – Results should be shared early and often with the organization.
* Applicable – KPIs must apply broadly to everyone, not just a select few.
* Achievable – They must be realistically attainable.
* Incremental – Progress should be measurable continuously, not only at rare "big bang" milestones.

## Background

Company-wide KPIs sound like a great idea: announce them, and everyone works toward improving them!

However, in practice, KPIs are often:

* Financial metrics that are really the CEO's KPIs. They may be critical to leadership but don't map clearly to most employees' day-to-day work.
* Project priorities or checklists masquerading as KPIs. These are goals or tasks—not true performance indicators.

Despite good intentions, here's what often happens after non-KPIs are rolled out:

* Many employees feel demoralized because they can't connect their work to the announced KPIs.
* Managers ask teams to invent individual KPIs that somehow "roll up" to the company's KPIs.
* Essential work—either intentionally or unintentionally—falls through the cracks.
* Team and individual KPIs are forgotten within weeks as normal work priorities resurface.
* The original company KPIs are never mentioned again.

I've lived through this scenario multiple times!

## An Example of a Good KPI

Everyone wants things to go faster, so a good company-wide KPI might be:
"Response time to customers."

This KPI is broadly applicable and easy to map across departments:

* Accounting: Time to process accounts payable
* Legal: Response and resolution time to internal clients
* Technical Operations: System uptime
* Engineering: Page load time
* Marketing: Lead response time

It applies to everyone. It also meets all the durability, transparency, applicability, achievability, and incrementality criteria listed earlier.

## Implementation

Good KPIs often require software infrastructure to track and measure progress accurately. Setting up these systems is an excellent use of engineering managers' time—they leverage their skills, stay engaged without disrupting core projects, and collaborate with non-engineering teams.

Given the commitment required, it's entirely possible that your organization isn't ready yet for company-wide KPIs. That's okay. It's better to have no company KPIs than to announce KPIs that quickly become orphaned.
