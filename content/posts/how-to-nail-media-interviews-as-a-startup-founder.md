Early PR coaching taught me to be cautious:

* “Don’t say this.”
* “Be careful—they might trick you.”
* “Stick to the script.”

But playing it safe leads to boring interviews. And boring = forgettable.

Here’s what actually works 👇 

💡 A few truths first:

*  No one knows anything about your startup.
Even if you think you’ve made it—VCs are reaching out, people are talking—you’re still a nobody to the broader world. Assume that.
*  Writers are not out to get you.

Unless you’re a massive jerk (and that becomes the story), most journalists aren’t looking to do a hit piece. They usually want to write something positive—or at the very least, balanced. Trashing a founder can come off as petty, and writers don’t want to risk burning bridges with your network (investors, lawyers, team, founder friends, etc.).

✅ What to do instead:

1. Research the writer.
Read the writer’s recent pieces. Mention them. Show you’ve done your research. Find something personal—where they live, studied, or a shared interest. It shows respect and builds instant goodwill.
2. Be candid.
Don’t stress about saying the “perfect” thing. Be honest, real, and earnest.
It’s refreshing—and usually endearing. Authenticity builds trust and makes the writer want to represent you well.
3. Give more than you take.

Thank them for their time. Ask what else they’re working on, and offer to help—even if it’s not about you.
Yes, you want coverage, but the best relationships are mutual. If you help them now, they’re much more likely to write about you later (and do it well).

⚠️ After it’s published: Expect to be misquoted.

Seriously. It will happen. Don’t freak out—unless it's something truly damaging (which it probably won’t be if you followed the above).
Let it slide. Most people won’t notice, and those who do will forget soon enough.

💬 At the end of the day, getting written about is a privilege.

* Be passionate.
* Be humble.
* Don’t be an a**hole.

This is the way.
