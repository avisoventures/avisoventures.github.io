Debt basically means you’re raising money from a bank/financial entity that will loan you money that you will have to pay back in the future but that you can use to finance growth of your company instead of having to sell equity and dilute the company. This is an intuitive concept but a relatively uncommon path for raising money so I find it to be something a lot of founders I know don’t think about as much. 

The general trend and advice I’d give is to create a mixed source of capital as you raise money and grow your company and (potentially) lean heavier on debt as you grow the company's revenue over time. This may mean that in your series B round, for example, you raise 20 million in equity and 5 million in debt and get to announce a 25 million round but only have 20m of that round be dilutive. In your C you might have a higher percentage debt than your previous round. As you grow your revenue (especially recurring revenue) your risk as an entity to loan money to goes down and the rate you can get the money loaned to you becomes more and more preferential. Investors typically don’t want your company to do this cause it means they get to own less of the company thus you don’t see as many first time founders using debt as a fund raising source. Mixing your source of capital will help you reduce dilution. 

Tradeoffs: Simple: you have to pay this money back and the more debt you have on the books, the more gets taken out of a potential future acquisition that needs to be paid back to the bank. You also have to pay money annually or quarterly to the bank so this type of funding can be “expensive” from a cash flow perspective depending on the terms you get. 

Pro Tip 1: If you bank with someone who offers debt (like SVB who is known for this for example) you’d likely to get preferential terms and in a really bad situation preferential forgiveness on the loan. 

Pro tip 2: When banks compete, you win. Make sure you have multiple offers on debt just like on equity raises. You can use the market competition to drive better terms for the company.
