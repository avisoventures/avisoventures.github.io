# Learning from Mistakes with an Issue Log for Business Operations

Ray Dalio mentiones in his book "Principles," the Issue Log that was used to learn from mistakes and radically improve the culture and processes at Bridgewater. 

It works like this:

* Errors or mistakes go in the Issue Log, with description, severity and "who was responsible"
* If it goes in the log, all is ok
* If mistake is found, and not in the log, there will be problems.
* "Management" needs to review the issue log in a timely, regular manner with some process.

Some clarifications:

* "Who was responsible" I assume is more like "who touched the problem last" or "who discovered the problem".
* While he claims it was applied company-wide, it likely works best for parts of the company with frequent semi-manual transactions.
* The last point, where things that going into log needs be reviewed was only implied.
* This is a major time and management committment.
* You'll need some scale in order to make this work.

It's not an exact mapping to DevOps style "Blameless Postmortems" but perhaps similar in spirit.

The Original Source
===================

It's interesting, that 20-30 later, Ray Dalio remembers this, and thought it was crucial for the success of the company, and devotes 3 pages ot it in his book Principles. Interestingly, the Issue Log, or Error Log as it was originally called, is not in the index.

In my edition of Principles, it starts on page 61-62:

> [circa 1990s] ...It was a terrible and costly error, and I could've done something dramatic like fire Ross to set a tone that mistakes would not be tolerated. But since mistakes happen all the time, that would have only encouraged other people to hide theirs, which would have led to even bigger and more costly errors. I believed strongly that we should bring problems and disagreements to the surface to learn what should be done to make things better. So Ross and I worked to build out an "error log" in the trading department. From then on, anytime there was any kind of bad outcome (a trade wasn't executed, we paid significantly higher transaction costs than expected, etc.), the traders would make a record of it and we would follow up. As we consistently tracked and addressed those issues, our trade execution machine continually improved.

> ...If something went badly, you had to put it in the log, characterize its severity, and make clear who was responsible for it. If a mistake happened and you logged it, you were okay. If you didn't log it, you would be in deep trouble. This way managers had problems brought to them, which was worlds better than having to seek them out. 

It's discussed again in the Appendix on page 548.

On Ray Dalio, Bridgewater, Principles
===========================

* There are strong opinions on Ray Dalio and Bridgewater. 
* I don't have any first hand knowledge on either.
* I'll review the book Principles another time.
* This is just about the Issue Log idea.
