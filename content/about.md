I've been at more startups than you.

* Signal Sciences - Founder, CTO, occasional COO and VP Eng.
* Etsy - Among other things, I built out their security, fraud, business intelligence systems.
* RightMedia / AppNexus / IPONWeb - All were at the birth of programmatic online advertising, all had big exits.
* Friendster - Yeah that Friendster.  What a wild time.
* Upromise -  Still around, sorta. I quit when I got the email "The company has been devalued by 90%.  Would you like to buy more shares?"
* SightPath - "A CDN for the Intranet, in a Box" sold to Cisco. Let me tell you what happened when I put a $1M stock certificate in the desk drawer and went on vacation.
* [Open Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Market) - started in 1994, went IPO and promptly fell into the chasm and died.

Along the way I did a lot speaking on the intersection of engineering, operations and security ([examples1](https://www.slideshare.net/nickgsuperstar/presentations), [examples2](https://speakerdeck.com/ngalbreath)).

Prior that I bailed out of a PhD program in mathematics at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/math/), since I thought this Internet thing might be something. Before that I picked up a mathematics degree from [University of Minnesota](https://cse.umn.edu/math) and did research at [Los Alamos National Laboratory - T13 group](https://cnls.lanl.gov/), [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/mcs), [Minnesota Supercomputing Institute](https://www.msi.umn.edu/), and the [Geometry Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_Center).

In addition, I authored a large number of [patents](https://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=0&f=S&l=50&TERM1=Galbreath%2C+Nicholas&FIELD1=INNM&co1=AND&TERM2=&FIELD2=&d=PTX), a [book on cryptography](https://www.amazon.com/Cryptography-Internet-Database-Applications-Developing/dp/0471210293/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3BB4VEHTZR0UX&keywords=Nick+galbreath&qid=1644966507&sprefix=nick+galbreath%2Caps%2C134&sr=8-1), and maybe a [paper](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sc/1993/01263494/12OmNAiXjfe) or [two](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/268500-parallel-solution-three-dimensional-time-dependent-ginzburg-landau-equation).

## Nuts and Bolts

The name *aviso* comes the [aviso boats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviso) which was used to carry messages between other ships, prior to electronic communications.
