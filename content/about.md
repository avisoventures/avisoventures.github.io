## We'd Love To Tell You More

For the time being, we must be mysterious.

## Nuts and Bolts

The name *aviso* comes the [aviso boats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviso) which was used to carry messages between other ships prior to electronic communications.

Our logo came from a design contest at [99 Designs](https://99designs.com/).

The website is static, made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and deployed using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).  And [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for UI components. At least for now.
